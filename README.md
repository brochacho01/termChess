termChess is a project by Lachlan Imel and is a successor to his termCheckers project.

This project has the WWU CS network filesystem in mind.

It is designed for two users to ssh into the same computer and play chess with eachother over a local tcp socket through two unique terminal sessions.

To compile and run enter make run. Note that for a player to connect, a host must first exist on the computer.
